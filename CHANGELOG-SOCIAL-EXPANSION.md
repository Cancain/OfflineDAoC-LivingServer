# Social Expansion changelog

What this fork adds to shadowofze's Offline DAoC. The base game's own changes are in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). The newest version is first.

## 0.36-chris.11 — 2026-10-17

The first release, for Offline DAoC **0.36 / 0.36b** (with or without the 0.36c new client). It
replaces the server (`GameServer.dll`) and the launcher (which gets a **Social Expansion** tab).
Every feature starts **switched off**: with all of them off, the game plays like the normal 0.36.

**Features**
- **Bot guilds.** Each realm's bots form guilds with a purpose (leveling, social, RvR, raiding,
  crafting). They wear guild names, talk in /gu, group with guildmates and recruit you when you
  ask "lf guild", even from your realm's starting guild. Guilds claim and defend keeps, pay dues,
  earn merit, buy guild buffs and form alliances. You can also /ginvite bots into your own
  guild. See [docs/BOT-GUILDS.md](docs/BOT-GUILDS.md).
- **Bot personalities.** Six types (Leveler, Socialite, Daredevil, Explorer, Crafter,
  No-lifer) and five traits tilt how each bot spends its time. `/personality` on a bot shows
  its type.
- **Bot voices and /faction debates.** 979 lines written for 2002–2003, chosen by realm, class,
  level, situation and personality, in five writing styles. 296 multi-bot /faction scenes, one
  every 30–45 minutes while you play. A busy speaker is waited for, so scenes play to the end.
  See [docs/BOT-PERSONALITIES.md](docs/BOT-PERSONALITIES.md).
- **XP by level range.** Separate player and bot rates for level bands. See
  [docs/XP-BY-LEVEL-RANGE.md](docs/XP-BY-LEVEL-RANGE.md).
- **Living Server.** Bots remember you (greetings, thanks, gossip by name). Dings get grats, and
  server firsts are announced. Dead bots ask you for a rez, and passing healers rez you. Frontier
  bots call enemy groups in /faction. Bots keep nemesis records. Bots log on and off on a
  schedule, take "brb" breaks and now and then go linkdead. The **Camelot Herald** is a news page
  of your world. Each part has its own switch. See [docs/LIVING-SERVER.md](docs/LIVING-SERVER.md).
- **Talking to bots by name.** `/send <bot>` reaches an online bot of your realm, and it answers
  with a tell. Ask to join and it tells you to invite it: you lead, bots join. `/invite <name>`
  invites a nearby bot (same region, within 6,000 units). `/target <name>` targets a nearby
  friendly bot.

**Fixes to the base game's bots** (also with every feature off)
- A bot that dies 3 times on its way to its group's meetup now counts as a no-show. Before, a
  low-level group could spend the full 15-minute wait dying (about 70 deaths in one case).
- Dead bots no longer jump to their spawn point the moment they die. Their corpse stays where it
  fell until they release.

**New client (0.36c) fixes, in the source only.** The target window's FACE, FOLLOW and STICK
buttons, `/target <name>` and `/assist` now work, and a second `/stick` or `/follow` turns it off.
These are in [source/new-client](source/new-client); this release's zip doesn't include new-client
files.

**Tested**
- **Automated:** 2,911 server tests pass on CI.
- **In game** (owner's PC, new client, 300 bots per realm, every feature on):
  - Seen working: guild recruiting and alliances, debates, frontier alarms, breaks, bot memory and
    gossip, rez asks, a bot rezzing you, grats and server firsts, tells, /invite and /target by
    name, and XP by level for players. Bot XP by level raises bots' XP in game, but the exact
    factor wasn't measured; see docs/XP-BY-LEVEL-RANGE.md.
  - Not yet seen in game: keep claims, guild merit, linkdeads, nemesis chat lines, you rezzing a
    bot, and the meetup fix.
  - The original game client wasn't tried.
